# Henriks onscreen krita shortcut buttons

A simple python plugin for Krita that creates a dock with some shortcuts that I use in my workflow in tablet mode.

I started to use Krita on a 2-in-1 linux laptop in tablet mode and I missed my wacom expresskeys, so I just hacked together this docker with some shortcut buttons.
